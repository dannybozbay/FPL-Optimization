## About The Project

The goals of this project are:

- **Optimizing Fantasy Premier League Team Performance**: The primary goal of this project is to use linear programming techniques, implemented through PuLP in Python, to maximize the expected points of a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team. By formulating constraints and objectives, the algorithm aims to select the most effective lineup, captain, and potential transfers for each gameweek.

- **Incorporating FPL Rules and Custom Constraints**: This project successfully integrates FPL rules, such as limitations on the number of players from each team, into the optimization process. Additionally, custom constraints, like ensuring a minimum probability of player appearances, are incorporated to enhance the realism and effectiveness of the optimized team selections.

- **Enhancing Decision-Making and Performance Prediction**: By leveraging linear programming and probability calculations, this project aids FPL managers in making informed decisions about their team composition and strategy. By optimizing expected points while adhering to FPL regulations and strategic preferences, the project aims to improve team performance over the course of the season.
